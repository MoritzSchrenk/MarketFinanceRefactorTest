1. File structure - interfaces and classes in the same file, filenames not matching the classes they contain, classes in unrelated folders
2. No unit tests present
3. ProductApplicationService is confusing, uses multiple return points, and redundant code e.g. when building CompanyDataRequest
4. Inconsistent and missing xml-docs
5. Magic numbers in the code (e.g. default advance percentage)
